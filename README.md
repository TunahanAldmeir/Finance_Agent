# Project Title

## Description
This project implements a simple AI text generation agent using the `phi` library. The agent leverages the Groq model to produce coherent and contextually relevant responses based on user prompts. The primary functionality includes:

- **AI Text Generation**: The agent can generate creative and engaging text, such as stories or responses to queries.
- **Environment Configuration**: Utilizes the `dotenv` package to manage environment variables for seamless configuration.
- **Model Customization**: The agent is built on the Groq model, allowing for flexibility in the type of responses generated.

This project serves as a foundational example of how to integrate AI capabilities into applications, providing a basis for further development and exploration of AI-driven text generation.
